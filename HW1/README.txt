Running driver.py requires texttable library. This will run both optimizers 1000 times
and will store some graphs in ./boxplots.

You can test the optimizers individually by using the public functions provided in the
optimizer_1d.py and optimizer_2d.py files. Examples are shown in the files themselves at the bottom.
